# Spotify Clone

An intricately crafted clone of the Spotify web player, designed to mirror the sleek and modern interface that Spotify is known for. This project is a testament to the power of HTML and CSS in recreating a visually engaging user interface.

## Technologies Used

This project is built solely using **HTML** and **CSS**, demonstrating how powerful front-end technologies can create a highly polished and responsive design without the need for JavaScript or backend functionality. Every element of the design—from navigation to the music player—has been meticulously structured to resemble the original.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts gracefully across various screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
- **Custom Icons & Imagery**: Leverages Font Awesome for icons and carefully selected assets to bring the interface to life.
- **Music Player Mockup**: Includes a fully styled (though non-functional) music player that visually mimics the Spotify experience.

## Limitations

This project is a static representation and does not include any functionality beyond the visual aspects. None of the buttons or music controls are interactive.

## Author

Crafted with dedication by **Me**, this clone serves as a showcase of front-end development skills and a deep understanding of layout design.
